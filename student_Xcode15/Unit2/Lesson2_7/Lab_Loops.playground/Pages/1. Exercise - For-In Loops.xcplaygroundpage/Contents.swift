 Create a for-in loop that loops through values 1 to 100, and prints each of the values.
 */ for index in 1...100 {
 print("This is number \(index)")
}


//:  Create a for-in loop that loops through each of the characters in the `alphabet` string below, and prints each of the values alongside the index.
let alphabet = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" 
for index in A...Z {
print("This is letter \(index)")
}


//:  Create a `[String: String]` dictionary, where the keys are names of states and the values are their capitals. Include at least three key/value pairs in your collection, then use a for-in loop to iterate over the pairs and print out the keys and values in a sentence.
["North Carolina": Raleigh, "Tennessee": Nashville, "South Carolina": Columbia] 
for index in North Carolina {
 print("This is capital \(Raleigh)")
]
for index in Tennessee {
 print("This is capital \(Nashville)")
